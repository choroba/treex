=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::A2A::RemoveEmptyNodes

=item DESCRIPTION

This block removes all empty a-nodes added by T2A::GenerateEmptyNodes, by
A2A::AddEnhancedUD or by any other block if they use the same hack (attached
directly under the artificial root, deprel is 'dep:empty'). This cleanup is
useful before the data is used in an application that cannot understand the
hack and would treat the nodes as regular a-nodes. For example, we do not want
to display such nodes in PML-TQ.

Note that removing empty nodes may break the integrity of enhanced dependency
graphs, which are encoded as wild attributes of nodes (another hack). It is not
a problem if we will remove / have removed the enhanced dependencies as well,
or at least if we are sure that nobody will attempt to traverse the graph.
