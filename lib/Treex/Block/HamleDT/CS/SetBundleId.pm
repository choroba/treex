After importing PDT or a similar treebank to Treex and before further processing
towards UD, it is useful to normalize the various ids. If writing CoNLL-U is
intended, bundle id is important because it will be used as sentence id in the
CoNLL-U file. We typically want it to have three components: document identifier
(a string of lowercase letters and digits, possibly also underscores, hyphens,
periods or colons), followed by -pMsN where M is the paragraph number within the
document, and N is the sentence number within the paragraph (the sentence number
can have a letter after the digits, which may be used if a sentence is later
split to several sentences). This structure may again impact a CoNLL-U file,
where it may be used to detect document and paragraph boundaries.
