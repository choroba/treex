=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::HamleDT::SetMiscNEFromPropn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Certain treebanks (especially those donated to UD by Google) overuse the PROPN
tag (proper noun). They use the tag for every word in a multi-word named entity,
although the word should actually be something else (e.g., a title of a movie
is a named entity but it may consist entirely of regular words).

Some of these words can be identified and re-tagged automatically, in particular
function words such as determiners and adpositions. However, it would be a pity
to lose the information that there is a multi-word named entity. So we run this
simple block, which will project the PROPN tag to the MISC attribute NamedEntity=Yes.

This block was created when some function words in the multi-word named entities
had already been re-tagged. We will have to look at the old version of the data
(e.g., UD release 1.0 of UD_German) in order to find out whether these words
were a part of the named entity or not. Before we do so, we will take every
word that is in the neighborhood of a named entity and has a non-major category
(UPOS other than NOUN, PROPN, ADJ, VERB, ADV), and give it the MISC attribute
NamedEntity=Maybe.
