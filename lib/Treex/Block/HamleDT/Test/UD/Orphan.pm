=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::HamleDT::Test::UD::Orphan

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If a verb has a conj child that is a noun and is not a nonverbal predicate
(there is no copula), chances are that it is a promoted orphaned argument of
a conjunct verb. If there is another argument, it should be attached as orphan.
