=item Treex::Block::HamleDT::Udep

Converts dependency trees from the HamleDT/Prague style to the Universal
Dependencies. This block is experimental. In the future, it may be split into
smaller blocks, moved elsewhere in the inheritance hierarchy or otherwise
rewritten. It is also possible (actually quite likely) that the current
Harmonize* blocks will be modified to directly produce Universal Dependencies,
which will become our new default central annotation style.
