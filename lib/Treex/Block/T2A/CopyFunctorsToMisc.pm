=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::T2A::CopyFunctorsToMisc

=item DESCRIPTION

If an a-node has a counterpart in a t-tree, copies its functor from the t-node
to the MISC attribute of the a-node. This block uses the back-references from
the a-tree to the t-tree that we create in T2A::GenerateA2TRefs and in T2A::
GenerateEmptyNodes. We thus no longer consider the get_lex_anode() method of
a t-node. (That method does not know about the empty nodes in Enhanced UD,
so it would not work well for generated t-nodes.) This block should thus be
called after those two blocks.
