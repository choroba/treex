Treex::Block::T2A::GenerateA2TRefs

=item DESCRIPTION

T-nodes have references to a-nodes (lex.rf and aux.rf) but there are no back
references from a-nodes to t-nodes. When exporting a mixture of a- and t-layer
annotations in certain formats, we may have to access t-nodes from their
lexical a-nodes. This block generates such references and stores them as wild
attributes of the a-nodes.
