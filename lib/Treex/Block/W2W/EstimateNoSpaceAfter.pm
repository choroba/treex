=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::W2W::EstimateNoSpaceAfter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<no_space_after> attribute of nodes encodes whether the current token was
separated by a whitespace from the next token in the original sentence before
tokenization.

If this information is not available in the corpus, we can estimate it
according to usual typographical rules. It mostly affects punctuation symbols
attached to the previous or to the following token. Note however that it is not
completely language-independent (for example, quotation marks are attached to
the quoted contents in English but not in French). It is also not possible (or
at least not easy) to recover all contexts. If tokenization split decimal
numbers on the decimal point, we could make an error if we treat the decimal
point as a normal period.

This block only adds the C<no_space_after> flags but it never removes them.
It assumes that these flags have not been present in the text.

Undirected quotation marks are treated in a primitive way.
The odd-numbered quotes are considered opening, the even-numbered closing.
It will not work properly if a quote is missing or if the quoted text spans
multiple sentences.

Directed typographical quotes are language-dependent (e.g. the English opening
quote is used as closing quote in Czech). Language-specific rules are currently
ignored.
